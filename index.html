            iOS applications using React and <br />
            the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
            JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs <br />
            APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI
            using React components:
            <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code.</i> You can learn more about
            React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components
            work in React Native.

            React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for
            building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React
            Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get
            you started or can serve as a refresher course.

            cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need

            <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
            write eleThe React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can
            refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
            variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
            name, and embedding it with curly braces inside ments inside
            JavaScript like so:

            <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
            configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs
            personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
            changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
            your components memory!

            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be called
            every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes
            a function to be called when the text is submitted.
          </p>
          <p class="Chapter-text">
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
            there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
